# Real-Time Noise Reduction App
Real-Time Implementation and
Evaluation of Wide Dynamic Range
Compression and Noise Reduction

This repository contains the project shell and algorithms needed for the implementation of
an Android smartphone app that implements functions used in hearing aids
consisting of wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) and noise reduction (NR).
